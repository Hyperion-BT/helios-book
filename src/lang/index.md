# The Helios language

The Helios language is a purely functional programming language, with a simple curly braces syntax. It is inspired by [Go](https://go.dev) and [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org).

## Tenets

- Readability is more important than writeability
- Easily auditable, it should be easy to spot malicious code
- Opinionated, there should be only one obvious way of doing things

## Structure of this chapter

In this chapter we will refer to the Helios language simply as *Helios*.

We start this chapter by explaining the basic syntax of Helios, and then move onto higher level concepts like [functions](./functions/index.md), [structs](./user-defined-types/structs.md) and [enums](./user-defined-types/enums.md).

This chapter ends with a complete reference of the [Helios builtins](./builtins/index.md).
