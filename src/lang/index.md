# Helios language reference

The Helios language is a purely functional programming language, with a simple curly braces syntax. It is inspired by [Go](https://go.dev) and [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org).

## Tenets

- Helios should be readable by as many programmers as possible, readability is more important than writeability
- Helios is opionated, there should be only one obvious way of doing things
- Helios is safe, it should be easy to spot malicious code

## Structure of this chapter

This chapter starts by explaining the basic syntax of Helios, and then moves onto higher level concepts like [functions](./functions.md), [structs](./structs.md) and [enums](./enums.md).

This chapter ends with a complete reference of the [Helios builtins](./builtins/index.md).
