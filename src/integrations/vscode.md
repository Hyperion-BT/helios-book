# VSCode IDE plugin

This plugin can be installed from within VSCode by searching for 'Helios' and picking the plugin with the 'Helios language support for VS Code' caption.

Currently this plugin only provides **syntax highlighting** for files ending with the `.hl` extension.

## Third party language server

There is also a third party language server plugin with more advanced features like auto-complete for Helios v0.9. This plugin is called 'Helios Language Server' and requires separate installation of the [python language server](https://pypi.org/project/helios-language-server).
